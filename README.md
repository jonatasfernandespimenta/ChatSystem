### This is my first project using WebSockets, hope you all like it, it's kinda basic but it works ðŸ˜‰

To get started make sure you have both NodeJS and npm installed, if not, check this link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
And if you want to make sure you have both installed just type at the console:

```console
hello@world:~$ node -v
hello@world:~$ npm -v
```

After it, open the BackEnd folder in cmd and type
```console
hello@world:~$ npm i
hello@world:~$ node app.js
```
and after do the same at the front folder but instead of node app.js, type:
```console
hello@world:~$ npm start
```

And also my friend [AldriÃª Mizobuti](http://github.com/Aldrie) helped me with it, go check his profile.
