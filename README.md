To get started open the BackEnd folder in cmd and type
```console
hello@world:~$ npm i
```
and after do the same at the front folder

This is my first project using WebSockets, hope you all like it, it's kinda basic but it works ðŸ˜‰

And also my friend [AldriÃª Mizobuti](http://github.com/Aldrie) helped me with it, go check his profile.
